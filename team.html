    <h1>Our Team</h1>
    <p>HackBlue is divided into four committees: Mentorship, Curriculum Development, Web Development,
      and Youtube Development. Each member of HackBlue is a member of at least one of the above committees,
      with some members electing to participate in multiple. </p>

          <h3>Mentorship</h3>
          <p>HackBlue mentors obtain their status by consistently attending one of our mentorship programs on a weekly basis.
              By presenting and teaching a chosen curriculum to students as well as offering one-on-one help during our lessons,
              mentors are able to form meaningful mentor-mentee relationships with the students and foster further computer science exploration.</p>

        <div class="see-through-box-2">
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>The HackBlue Web Development Committee was created with the primary goal of coding this working website for the organization. This website was coded from scratch using HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript.
              Future projects will include adding additional features to the
              HackBlue website as well as other projects relevant to the field of web development.</p>

          <h3>Curriculum Development</h3>
          <p>The HackBlue Curriculum Development Committee creates all of the curriculum that is taught to mentors. Curriculum topics include traditional
            off-computer computer science lessons which teach beginner concepts, as well as lessons which utilize tools such as Python, Scratch, and Raspberry Pi.
            Other lesson topics include web development and working with custom-built robots.</p>

          <h3>YouTube Development</h3>
          <p>The HackBlue Youtube Development Committee writes, films, and edits informational YouTube videos about basic computer science concepts to be viewed by
          the students in our programs as well as the public at large. Visit our official YouTube channel <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXLmokWhR2WlS1iijkuZJ_w">here</a>.</p>
