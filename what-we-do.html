  <h1 class="header-content">Who We Are & What We Do</h1>
  <!-- insert blurb section, and picture link (needs to be added)-->
  <p class="text-content" align="left" style="padding: 15px 30px;">We are a U of M organization that teaches underprivileged middle-school-age students in the greater Ann Arbor
    area basic coding concepts. We are currently partnering with four local after-school programs in order to
    spread interest in computer science to communities that wouldn’t otherwise have access. We hope to spread
    opportunities for education in technology for all students starting with those in our local community. We
    have weekly mentorship programs and career treks to local tech companies to enrich the programs that we serve.
    Additionally, HackBlue provides career development and exclusive networking events to its members to improve
    career trajectory.</p>

      <h2 class="header-content" align="center"> Our Goals </h2>
        <p class="text-content" align="left">To get kids interested in computer science! The students that we teach are those that may not have been
         introduced to CS otherwise, and we want to show them that coding is not only fun and interesting, but also
         accessible and a thing that they can do.</p>
         <p class="text-content" align="left">By having the same group of members consistently attend each respective program, we are able to build
         relationships with the kids and mentor them through the learning process. Since many of these students might
         not necessarily have a surplus of positive role models in their lives, cultivating these kinds of relationships
         is extremely meaningful and impactful.</p>
      <h2 class="header-content" align="center">Perks</h2>
         <p class="text-content" align="left">No computer science experience is required! We focus on problem solving and the coding concepts, not the
           syntactical stuff.</p>
         <p class="text-content" align="left">This is a great networking opportunity; members are able to interact with other UM students who are
           interested in technical fields.</p>
         <p class="text-content" align="left">This is an awesome resume builder; being able to say that you’ve taught code to underprivileged
           kids really stands out to recruiters.</p>
         <p class="text-content" align="left">Professional development; throughout the semester we host various presentations and workshops
           designed to help with and give insight on the tech recruiting process.</p>
         <p class="text-content" align="left" style="padding-bottom:15px;">We host social bonding events so organization members can get to know each other and to aid in
           networking within the organization, the computer science major, and the university at large.</p>
